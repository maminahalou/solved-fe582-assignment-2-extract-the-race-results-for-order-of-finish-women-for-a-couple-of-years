Follow the example in Lecture 3 on Data and Web Technologies (Modeling Runners’ Times). Use the Race Results 2001-2012 link (<u><a href="http://cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results_list.php">http://cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results_list.php</a></u> ) to extract the Race Results for Order of Finish – Women for a couple of years. Extract and clean the data for as many years as you can. Please do the following

<ul>

 <li>Box Plot of Age by Year for Female Runners</li>

 <li>Scatter Plot for Run Times vs. Age for Female Runners</li>

 <li>Fit Models to Average Performance</li>

 <li>Side-by-Side Boxplots of Female Runners’ Run Time vs. Age</li>

 <li>Residual Plot from Fitting a Simple Linear Model of Performance to Age</li>

 <li>Loess Curves Fitted to Run Time vs. Age</li>

 <li>Line Plot of the Number of Female Runners by Year</li>

 <li>Density Curves for the Age of Female Runners for 2 years (smallest and largest year that you analyzed)</li>

 <li>Loess Curves Fit to Performance for 2 years (smallest and largest year that you analyzed) Female Runners</li>

 <li></li>

 <li>Difference between Loess Curves of the predicted run time for 2 years (smallest and largest year that you analyzed)</li>

 <li>Perform comparative analysis of the performance of the male runners (previously analyzed in class) and female runners for the yearly data that you selected.</li>

</ul>
